# scripts-pwsh

This git repo contains my personal collection of **Powershell** shell scripts.

It also includes `.bat` files which are similar.

## Directories

- `.\old`: old stuff
- `.\config`: config files for `pwsh`, **Windows Terminal**, and other config related to **Powershell**.
- `.\pwsh_help`: random powershell help files (ignored by git).
- `.\tests`: test folder for testing output (ignored by git).
- `.\bin`: Small startup scripts are located here, including a pwsh -noprofile startup script.

The `gotosleep.bat` file had been created and linked to a custom task using `taskscheduler` on windows.  
INFO: **DO NOT MOVE**

## Other Files

- [Powershell snippets](D:/Carl/OneDrive/snippets/pwsh/powershell_snippets.txt): location for all snippet related things that are not necessarily
  important enough to be version-controlled.
- [TODO.txt](./TODO.txt): todo items relative to powershell programming.
