# ScriptsAndFunctions

This is a collection of different useful scripts I use daily.
I am working on consolidating them into categories like _Backup_, _Git_, _Text_, _FileSystem_, etc.

Important _scripts_ (as in `Get-InstalledScript`) will be separated from scripts designed to be _sourced_
into a _PSSession_.

As far as naming, I try to keep true to the **Powershell** way of _Verb-Noun_ nomenclature, although
_personalized_ scripts designed for me are sometimes named with no hyphen.

## Files

- `textFunctions.ps1`: A collection of text-based functions I'm working with.
